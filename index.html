			<h3>Tuesday 12th June</h3>
			The semester is very close to being over. I haven't received any centrelink payments because there seems to be a glitch in the system where I am not able to upload my papers correctly to the right subheading. I need to upload my current study details but it won't let me. My claim has been "in progress" for weeks. It's probably my fault for not providing the documents in time. The lady in Marrickville centrelink office said that I just had to wait and that there is not a technical issue. I'm going to go in again to see if I can get someone else to look at it and to see if there is someone higher who I could talk to. Having said that, I really cannot be bothered to chase the issue any further. I should just file another claim after withdrawing this current one.

			In my current living situation I am pretty content. Yeah things could be better, the washing machine could be working and there could be an oven but it's pretty sweet. I pay up to $15 in travel from my place which can be cut down to potentially $0 if I start riding my bike, which I should. I just need to buy a set of bike lights so I can ride at night. I need to look into my diet and start excercising. Im starting to feel like shiiit.
			<br><br>
			Got a haircut today. I went in with a sick looking moustache and a thick head of hair with wild sideburns and left with a too neato haircut and a sex offender lip hair. Went home and shaved my month long project off my face. Now im back to where I started. Baby face. fuck shit cunt. I had a dream of looking at least a couple years within my biological age. My mistake was trusting. I shouldnt trust people over my gut instinct. I knew that guy was not on the same page as me. The conversation went something like this. 
			<br> Hey brother. <br> Hey dude. <br>So how do you like it? <br> I want the sides to be short and the top to be kept long so I can do a slick back kind of thing, Ive always had a kind of combover thing muy whole life, just wanna try something new. <br> At this point I had a feeling he didnt really get what I was saying. <br> So how short do you want the sides? <br> a 1. <br> A 1? <br> The bewildered reaction was also a warning. <br> yeah <br> and how much off the top <br> I dunno I kind of want my hair to stop at the end of my head if you know what i mean, so about this much? but i dunno if you have a better idea, youre the expert <br> He starts cutting, asking if im off work, he said he got the monday off cos of queens birthday, and how it was too cold to do anything so he just had dinner with his family. trying to string together a conversation I agreed that it was too cold and i spent that night watching django unchained. He was like ohhh yeah yeah, i then said that the night before i wanted inglorious basterds. We then talk about current movies. This is when it gets great. He says hes behind on the current movies and how he hasnt seen deadpool 2 yet and how he wants to see it cos everyone else has seen it. Im like yeah im also behind on movies since i havent seen the new avengers movie. THEN this dudes eye light up like I just dug up a fond childhood memory and proceeds to praise the movie. THEN he proceeds to share with me the entire plotline of said movie. Luckily for me, I couldn't care less about the avengers or superhero movies. I even ask more about the plot when hes done telling me who dies and the speculations for the next movie. After this the conversation dies down as he concentrates on fading the sides of my head. To set the scene, the shop is empty. Actually when I entered the shop there were two dudes there, the guy who is cutting my hair presently was at the time cutting a redheads hair and his boss who had just finished cutting someone else's hair and receiving payment. When i take a seat to wait, he disappears into the bathroom. He continues to wait there the whole time the movie dude is barbering the redhead and i take a seat in the barbers chair. after i ask the movie dude if its just him in the shop the boss then comes out and leaves the shop for a while. I couldve sworn he was masturbating in there. Anyway, the boss dude comes back. At this point, movie man has already told me the plot of the avengers movie that i said i havent seen yet and i ask him about it more. he replied HESITANTLY. like he doesnt wanna spoil it for his boss or some shit. maybe he was concentrating. maybe he figured oh if he hasnt seen it by now he wont give a shit. maybe his boss had told him that he was gonna see the avengers movie when he has time in his busy schedule to watch it and doesnt want any spoilers or else he'll fire him. who knows. the haircut was alright. the fade is pretty good but it made my moustache look absolutely fucked up. next time i should just tell them to stop after cutting the sides. i think ive had this thought before.
			<br><br>
			this semester has been intersting. i think ive identified some of my problem with procrastination and the lack of motivation. its that i dont want to fail. i dont want to feel that pain of not being good enough. i put too much on the line when theres really nothing at stake really. i need to make peace with the fact that i have to be humble and ask around and stumble. i cant do this alone. i should be expected to. i shouldnt expect myself to do it alone. i have to face reality. the reality is that sometimes im not good enough. but thats okay. i need to learn self compassion. im afraid to face the unknown of the future because that clay void might turn into failure. if im afraid of what i would feel if i tried my best and failed but i know it wouldnt be the end of the world. i know it would be a temporary feeling that would even be beneficial and fuel my future dealings. maybe thats false because i tried really hard for my algorithmic design assignment. i mean i got a pretty good mark of 82% but going into the sound design assignment i didnt really try too hard. i didnt have the same feeling of man i really want to do a good job. that could also be due to eating badly. i was eating spring rolls and porridge and rice and fried chicken and oportos. i had the worst shit after the kfc last meal for leon. that tore me apart. lesson: self-compassion, dont be afraid of failure, dont try to do it alone. hey jude dont make it bad.

			i just drew a picture on the whiteboard about when mum was sick last. she was being tormented by her thoughts. a couple of people came over. i forgot who. maybe it was the people from the church group who sang for grandmas passing away prayer. they came over to check on mum. they sat down in the living room but mum was completely catatonic. she would not say anything. the two ladies left. mum stayed in her seat, didnt even say goodbye, or maybe she did. but she stayed in her seat and looked straight forward. comepletely captivated in the movie of her memory. she starts to cry but still keeping her eyes open and head facing forward still watching her thoughts play out. she has her hands on her kneeds palms up, slightly slouched. she looked like a baby when she cried. absolutely helpless in her dependance. absolutely uncared for in her dependance. absolutely alone in this movie. she wailed. MĘĘĘĘĘĘĘĘĘĘ. she cried like a baby. i sat next to her. i didnt know what to do. i just sat next to her and put my arms around her. maybe she can feel some warmth and that would snap her out of her trance. maybe if she felt that she was being hugged it would disconnect her from that cold place and make her realise that she is actually not there. <br> i want to keep this drawing on the board but i dont want to upset mum. i dont want to remind her of anything unpleasant. she has enough demons keeping her company. she has enough visitors drop in uninvited and unwelcome. 
			<br><br>
			maybe i do have something to say. maybe this is my story that i can tell. its definitely something that i think about. its burned in my memory. its fuel that i can use to create.
			<br><br>
			twitch dulls the mind so i dont have to think about the future. when i have to sleep theres a bit of fear in me. i think i might just think about things for hours and not sleep. thoughts that keep me awake. maybe writing is the antidote. twitch the sedation. meditate. dive into the fear. master it. retrieve the treasure that hides below and use it to the benefit of your reality.
			<h3>Wednesday 13th june 2018</h3>
			good morning. 2 slices of middle rasher bacon, 3 eggs and 3 pieces of toast. no vegetables. feel terrible. dad was gonna pick up a dog from the same person we got nana from but theyre not gonna give him away yet so their bitch can get pregnant. when we got nana she was covered in fleas. she was still just a puppy a few days old. she couldnt even open her eyes yet and there were fleas in the corner of her eyes. i was picking them out with tweezers. there were other puppies too. maybe one other. we gave it to our neighbour. it was black furred. it died after a few days. not sure how.
			<br><br>
			we used to have another pup. before nana. i think it was called nhi. i dont have any photos of her. we left her outside to eat with emmy. but dogs are pretty competitive when it comes to food so when nhi went in for a bite, emmy bit her head. nhi wouldnt stop crying after that. it would just cry all day and night. some days she wouldnt cry as much but she would always be crying. one day we took her to the vet to see what was wrong. she was euthanised. there was a fracture in her skull. emmy bit her good. emmy was a killer. didnt get in the way of me loving her though. 
			<br><br>
			emmy died in 2016 or 2015. it was when i was working at fogo brasilia in wetherill park. what a shit job. well the job wasnt shit it was just the boss. he was younger than me. actually the job was pretty shit. one day after his shift he changed his shirt in the kitchen cos he was going to the gym later. what a stooge douche. the look on his face as the girls remarked. the kitchen was in the middle of the food court too. the kind of kitchen where you could see everything. anyway. emmy died with a bloated belly. it was bloated for a few days before she died. right before though there was a moment where she looked at me. it was like she was saying goodbye and thanking me. there was a moment within that moment where i looked away but i looked back quickly after noticing that she was trying to tell me something. i wont ever forget that. i want to draw that moment. shortly after she looked at me she went over to the grass and laid down. her stomach on the grass. she slowly sank breaths getting shorter and shorter. i stroked her head until she passed. it was strange seeing her go. there was a feeling of regret. like i just wished she was alive for one more day so i could have spent more time with her. one more hour even. i wanted so much for her to lick my face again or bark at passers by. or just look into my eyes. or wake me up with her scratching at my bed. i hope she was happy. i hope she didnt die in pain. it didnt seem like it.
