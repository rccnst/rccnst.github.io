			<h3>Tuesday 12th June</h3>
			The semester is very close to being over. I haven't received any centrelink payments because there seems to be a glitch in the system where I am not able to upload my papers correctly to the right subheading. I need to upload my current study details but it won't let me. My claim has been "in progress" for weeks. It's probably my fault for not providing the documents in time. The lady in Marrickville centrelink office said that I just had to wait and that there is not a technical issue. I'm going to go in again to see if I can get someone else to look at it and to see if there is someone higher who I could talk to. Having said that, I really cannot be bothered to chase the issue any further. I should just file another claim after withdrawing this current one.
			<br><br>
			In my current living situation I am pretty content. Yeah things could be better, the washing machine could be working and there could be an oven but it's pretty sweet. I pay up to $15 in travel from my place which can be cut down to potentially $0 if I start riding my bike, which I should. I just need to buy a set of bike lights so I can ride at night. I need to look into my diet and start excercising. Im starting to feel like shiiit.
			<br><br>
			Got a haircut today. I went in with a sick looking moustache and a thick head of hair with wild sideburns and left with a too neato haircut and a sex offender lip hair. Went home and shaved my month long project off my face. Now im back to where I started. Baby face. fuck shit cunt. I had a dream of looking at least a couple years within my biological age. My mistake was trusting. I shouldnt trust people over my gut instinct. I knew that guy was not on the same page as me. The conversation went something like this. 
			<br> Hey brother. <br> Hey dude. <br>So how do you like it? <br> I want the sides to be short and the top to be kept long so I can do a slick back kind of thing, Ive always had a kind of combover thing muy whole life, just wanna try something new. <br> At this point I had a feeling he didnt really get what I was saying. <br> So how short do you want the sides? <br> a 1. <br> A 1? <br> The bewildered reaction was also a warning. <br> yeah <br> and how much off the top <br> I dunno I kind of want my hair to stop at the end of my head if you know what i mean, so about this much? but i dunno if you have a better idea, youre the expert <br> He starts cutting, asking if im off work, he said he got the monday off cos of queens birthday, and how it was too cold to do anything so he just had dinner with his family. trying to string together a conversation I agreed that it was too cold and i spent that night watching django unchained. He was like ohhh yeah yeah, i then said that the night before i wanted inglorious basterds. We then talk about current movies. This is when it gets great. He says hes behind on the current movies and how he hasnt seen deadpool 2 yet and how he wants to see it cos everyone else has seen it. Im like yeah im also behind on movies since i havent seen the new avengers movie. THEN this dudes eye light up like I just dug up a fond childhood memory and proceeds to praise the movie. THEN he proceeds to share with me the entire plotline of said movie. Luckily for me, I couldn't care less about the avengers or superhero movies. I even ask more about the plot when hes done telling me who dies and the speculations for the next movie. After this the conversation dies down as he concentrates on fading the sides of my head. To set the scene, the shop is empty. Actually when I entered the shop there were two dudes there, the guy who is cutting my hair presently was at the time cutting a redheads hair and his boss who had just finished cutting someone else's hair and receiving payment. When i take a seat to wait, he disappears into the bathroom. He continues to wait there the whole time the movie dude is barbering the redhead and i take a seat in the barbers chair. after i ask the movie dude if its just him in the shop the boss then comes out and leaves the shop for a while. I couldve sworn he was masturbating in there. Anyway, the boss dude comes back. At this point, movie man has already told me the plot of the avengers movie that i said i havent seen yet and i ask him about it more. he replied HESITANTLY. like he doesnt wanna spoil it for his boss or some shit. maybe he was concentrating. maybe he figured oh if he hasnt seen it by now he wont give a shit. maybe his boss had told him that he was gonna see the avengers movie when he has time in his busy schedule to watch it and doesnt want any spoilers or else he'll fire him. who knows. the haircut was alright. the fade is pretty good but it made my moustache look absolutely fucked up. next time i should just tell them to stop after cutting the sides. i think ive had this thought before.
			<br><br>
			this semester has been intersting. i think ive identified some of my problem with procrastination and the lack of motivation. its that i dont want to fail. i dont want to feel that pain of not being good enough. i put too much on the line when theres really nothing at stake really. i need to make peace with the fact that i have to be humble and ask around and stumble. i cant do this alone. i should be expected to. i shouldnt expect myself to do it alone. i have to face reality. the reality is that sometimes im not good enough. but thats okay. i need to learn self compassion. im afraid to face the unknown of the future because that clay void might turn into failure. if im afraid of what i would feel if i tried my best and failed but i know it wouldnt be the end of the world. i know it would be a temporary feeling that would even be beneficial and fuel my future dealings. maybe thats false because i tried really hard for my algorithmic design assignment. i mean i got a pretty good mark of 82% but going into the sound design assignment i didnt really try too hard. i didnt have the same feeling of man i really want to do a good job. that could also be due to eating badly. i was eating spring rolls and porridge and rice and fried chicken and oportos. i had the worst shit after the kfc last meal for leon. that tore me apart. lesson: self-compassion, dont be afraid of failure, dont try to do it alone. hey jude dont make it bad.
			<br><br>
			i just drew a picture on the whiteboard about when mum was sick last. she was being tormented by her thoughts. a couple of people came over. i forgot who. maybe it was the people from the church group who sang for grandmas passing away prayer. they came over to check on mum. they sat down in the living room but mum was completely catatonic. she would not say anything. the two ladies left. mum stayed in her seat, didnt even say goodbye, or maybe she did. but she stayed in her seat and looked straight forward. comepletely captivated in the movie of her memory. she starts to cry but still keeping her eyes open and head facing forward still watching her thoughts play out. she has her hands on her kneeds palms up, slightly slouched. she looked like a baby when she cried. absolutely helpless in her dependance. absolutely uncared for in her dependance. absolutely alone in this movie. she wailed. MĘĘĘĘĘĘĘĘĘĘ. she cried like a baby. i sat next to her. i didnt know what to do. i just sat next to her and put my arms around her. maybe she can feel some warmth and that would snap her out of her trance. maybe if she felt that she was being hugged it would disconnect her from that cold place and make her realise that she is actually not there. <br> i want to keep this drawing on the board but i dont want to upset mum. i dont want to remind her of anything unpleasant. she has enough demons keeping her company. she has enough visitors drop in uninvited and unwelcome. 
			<br><br>
			maybe i do have something to say. maybe this is my story that i can tell. its definitely something that i think about. its burned in my memory. its fuel that i can use to create.
			<br><br>
			twitch dulls the mind so i dont have to think about the future. when i have to sleep theres a bit of fear in me. i think i might just think about things for hours and not sleep. thoughts that keep me awake. maybe writing is the antidote. twitch the sedation. meditate. dive into the fear. master it. retrieve the treasure that hides below and use it to the benefit of your reality.
			<h3>Wednesday 13th june 2018</h3>
			good morning. 2 slices of middle rasher bacon, 3 eggs and 3 pieces of toast. no vegetables. feel terrible. dad was gonna pick up a dog from the same person we got nana from but theyre not gonna give him away yet so their bitch can get pregnant. when we got nana she was covered in fleas. she was still just a puppy a few days old. she couldnt even open her eyes yet and there were fleas in the corner of her eyes. i was picking them out with tweezers. there were other puppies too. maybe one other. we gave it to our neighbour. it was black furred. it died after a few days. not sure how.
			<br><br>
			we used to have another pup. before nana. i think it was called nhi. i dont have any photos of her. we left her outside to eat with emmy. but dogs are pretty competitive when it comes to food so when nhi went in for a bite, emmy bit her head. nhi wouldnt stop crying after that. it would just cry all day and night. some days she wouldnt cry as much but she would always be crying. one day we took her to the vet to see what was wrong. she was euthanised. there was a fracture in her skull. emmy bit her good. emmy was a killer. didnt get in the way of me loving her though. 
			<br><br>
			emmy died in 2016 or 2015. it was when i was working at fogo brasilia in wetherill park. what a shit job. well the job wasnt shit it was just the boss. he was younger than me. actually the job was pretty shit. one day after his shift he changed his shirt in the kitchen cos he was going to the gym later. what a stooge douche. the look on his face as the girls remarked. the kitchen was in the middle of the food court too. the kind of kitchen where you could see everything. anyway. emmy died with a bloated belly. it was bloated for a few days before she died. right before though there was a moment where she looked at me. it was like she was saying goodbye and thanking me. there was a moment within that moment where i looked away but i looked back quickly after noticing that she was trying to tell me something. i wont ever forget that. i want to draw that moment. shortly after she looked at me she went over to the grass and laid down. her stomach on the grass. she slowly sank breaths getting shorter and shorter. i stroked her head until she passed. it was strange seeing her go. there was a feeling of regret. like i just wished she was alive for one more day so i could have spent more time with her. one more hour even. i wanted so much for her to lick my face again or bark at passers by. or just look into my eyes. or wake me up with her scratching at my bed. i hope she was happy. i hope she didnt die in pain. it didnt seem like it.

			<h3>Saturday 16th June 2018</h3>
			i finished up on the last assignment yesterday for viscomm. I have a feeling im going to be repeating the course next year. shitfuck. oh well. its out of my hands now. i should have started on thursday seeing as how important it was. on my walk home i was so angry with myself. i didnt want to be around people at all. i kept telling myself that its okay. everytime i said that an unfamilar feeling washed over me. it felt nice but uncomfortable at the same time. i think it was self-compassion. i need to practice that more. that its okay to make mistakes. maybe that acknowledgement will help me learn from future mistakes by helping me be more ready to accept them. im a human being that makes mistakes and its okay.
			<br><br>
			i drank coffee. i put too much in. a tablespoons worth, im clenching my teeth just bracing the ride its taking me on. i just feel anxious. i think a teaspoon was a good amount to drink on friday. i didnt feel overwhelmed that day. 
			<br><br>
			listening to whiting wongs with dan harmon and jessica gao. i liked the episode 10 where the middle-eastern women explained their experience with their non-affectionate families. my family is very similar. on my birthday my dad gave me a handshake. he also told me not to ever love a girl because they will trick you and take advantage of you. i know thas ridiculous but i wonder how much of my unconscious thoughts for women is shaped by that. i do remember sharing that with some girls in year 12 when questioned as to why i wasn't asking another girl out. i used it then to escape from the situation. it didnt work and i ended up with a girlfriend. i dont remember exactly how that happened.
			<br><br>
			whiting wongs ep 12 where they talk about workplace situations where romantic feelings are involved reminds me of when i had feelings for somebody. it wasnt in the workplace but i just didnt know how to go about it. it was the confusion of what to do that i related to in this episode. i liked this girl but she didnt like me. i tried to hide my feelings because our friendship was great. i eventually just wasnt able to handle it and i stopped communicating to her. i feel like i lost a friend but what else could i do? i couldve just dealt with my feelings better. i couldve been honest with her and told her what i was going through. i was very selfish and was making our meetups weird i think. i would like to think that if i was in that situation now would be able to handle it better. the solution that was given in the podcast was empathy. i didnt practice empathy in that situation. she didnt deserve to receive the backlash of my lack of emotional intelligence. 
			<br><br>
			starting to learn unity again for the upcoming game jam on 29th. i have no idea wtf i am doing atm. its so boring trying to go through the references and learn that way. i want to have an idea and try to execute it and learn it that way.
			<br><br>
			a great game moment was in prey. when you smash the window to escape your room. it was great because you smash the window because you expect to go down some fire stairs or something but instead you break the monitors that were projecting a cityscape and reveal that just a few metres from the window was a desk where it was someones job to watch and record your every move. your initial expectation is met with a sick reality. also the metaphor of shattering reality unfolds right before your eyes right as the wrench makes contact with the window. arkane knew exactly what they were doing because they even slowed this moment down to enhance the effect.

			Dreamt i was playing around with explosives and someone called the police on me. felt scared that i was going to go to jail. i was scrambling to hide evidence that i was tinkering with electronics. i felt like i had to hide my curiosity. another aspect of the dream was that i had to close the window of my small glass room. there was rain coming in but i didnt know from where then i realised it was coming from above me. there was a pole that i had to wind to bring down the shades and shut the window to stop the rain from getting in. the window was high up. i felt like i was going to fall upwards when i tried to close the window. it would open up suddenly as i was closing it letting the rain through. i was afraid that i was going to fall into the ceiling window. 
			<h3>Saturday 23rd Jun 2018</h3>
			I'm sitting in the living room and looking at a framed picture that stands in front of a row of books on the first level of the huge cabinet housing other memorabilia. The picture contains mum and Nam standing in front of our house with the happiest smiles i've ever seen either put on their faces. My first thought was wow thats mean, wheres dad? It's right in the centre of this huge cabinet that faces the lounge chairs so the first thing that any visitors notice is this picture of mum and nam, dad is nowhere to be seen, hes probably taking the photo. Then I thought about Nam. His childhood was stupidly traumatic. He lived in fear of dad. If anything happened that displeased dad, nam would get a beating. There was a time where he was so abusive that mum took nam and be and left without warning, seeking refuge in a womens shelter for a while. Our uncle helped mum out with watching over nam and be. I was told that while mum was pregnant with nam, dad pinned mum to the ground and started choking her while sitting on her stomach. Eventually mum and dad reunited and decided to live under the same roof again. Then i was born. The timeline is a bit shaky. I remember dad and nam getting into fights as i was growing up. I never saw anything since this mostly happened after my bedtime, but i heard it. I remember dad would take off his belt and hit nam with it. it would start off with dad doing something that nam thought was wrong, they would argue and dad would beat him. who knows why the older generation beat their kids. maybe they were trying to prepare their children for the absolutely brutal world that awaited them. the world they were forced into when they were children. maybe he resented nam for forcing him to settle down after just fighting and escaping the war he fought in for seven years since he was 22. nam was forced to figure things out when he had no one to show him the way. mum stuggled with depression and was a stranger in australia. dad was a tyrant spouting axioms and based them anecdotaly on what he thought "the people do". Go to school, go to university, get a job, start a family. That was too normal. When you have an abnormal upbringing you tend to think about things differently, id think. I cant judge nam. I dont know what its like to go through what he went through. I feel like I'm wandering the postapocalyptic wasteland of my family's history, picking up shinies here and there in the rough. i owe so much to my brother. also, i dont think my dad is a bad person. 
			<br><br>
			thinking about sad thoughts gets me in that place where i want to write to get it out of me so i can put it on the screen and work it out. the feeling of lonliness, thinking about my family.
			<h3>24th Sunday June 2018</h3>
			the winter game should have a room where it lists every 'enemy' that you shielded from and maybe the opportunity to meet with them over coffee or dinner. Some would show up some wouldn't.
			<h3>Wed 4th July 2018</h3>
			Withdrew from the introductory logic unit. seemed pretty useless. I need to start getting my shit in order. 1) Compare the prices of produce of surrounding produce markets, farmers markets, supermarkets. 2) Buy enough containers to store in fridge for a week. 3 meals a day. 3) Buy a toaster oven. 4) Exercise. 5) Get absolutely jacked. 
			<br><br>
			I'm bored. Downloaded pokemon go this morning and enjoying the fresh air.
			<br><br>
			Turned 27 two days ago. Went home after my introductory logic class and ate pho and cake. Took photos. 
			<h3>Thurs 5th Jul 2018</h3>
			the following are complete mad ramblings from a newly 27 year old man. i just took a 1/3 of a trojka. peaking. watched porn and jerked off. felt alright. listened to asmr. felt amazing. tapped on the piano. wasnt that great. now listening to erroll garners autumn leaves. amazing. a lot of my physical mannerisms are manifestations of the resistance to be in the moment. my facial knots express the thoughts that run and run and run around in my head. i am relaxed and experiencing things as they come without the scan/filter. i feel lonely also. like i dont need to be lonely. i feel regret from being lonely and the loneliness combined. i guess its just baby steps. little improvements here and there. build up to it. compount interest. love yourself. dont be so hard on yourself. keep doing it. one step at a time. youll get there. i feel guilty too. like i shouldnt be doing this. but i have to learn to make the most of a situation. thats the pragmatic thing to do! i carry a lot of guilt. i need to come to terms with it. mainly about how i treat my friends. fear takes over too many times. i give into cowardice in the face of fear. i cant look people in the eye in case they see me. so i need to tell you guys something. im not a great person. in the past ive acted in ways that make me sick to even think about and i have to come clean about those actions. im sick about how i behaved during our times together when we were high. i know that everyone was high and whatever happens while high stays in highdom but i want to say that im sorry. also im sorry about how i behaved while on holiday. i dont know what i was thinking to act in such a manner but i want to say that im sorry. i want to be honest. i know it might sound strange and part of the reason why i didnt bring it up before is because i thought it might sound strange but i just need to clear it out for myself if anything. it might sound wierd but thats how i think.
